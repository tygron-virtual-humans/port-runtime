	/**
	 * <p>
	 * Informs the debugger that the thread under debug has reached a
	 * breakpoint. This method should be called <em>only</em> by the agent,
	 * never by an external thread. The call blocks if the breakpoint is in the
	 * {@link #pausingChannels}. It unblocks only after someone calls the debug
	 * control functions such as {@link #run()}. <br>
	 * If we notice the runmode is {@link RunMode#KILLED}, {@link ThreadDeath}
	 * is thrown.
	 * </p>
	 * *
	 * <p>
	 * Usage of breakpoint():<br>
	 * A call to breakpoint() may be inserted BEFORE the agent action takes
	 * place, so the debugger can indicate what the system is going to do, as
	 * well as AFTER the agent action has taken place. Doing so enables a
	 * programmer to see what is scheduled to happen BEFORE the action occurs,
	 * and to check what has happened after the action has been performed in
	 * order to identify any problems due to the action and in order to
	 * facilitate an effective analysis (this allows a programmer to check its
	 * expectations).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * IMPORTANT: do NOT place a {@link #breakpoint(String, Channel, Object)}
	 * inside a synchronized block if you want to support multi-threading.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * It is recommended to use past tense for breakpoints reporting an event
	 * that has happened, and to use future tense for events that are going to
	 * happen after the breakpoint.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param channel
	 *            channel on which to the breakpoint message is reported. Also
	 *            see class {@link Channel}.
	 * @param associate
	 *            The object being associated with the breakpoint. May be null
	 *            if the breakpoint is not associated with any object. See
	 *            {@link AgentProgram#getBreakpointObjects()} for which
	 *            {@link IParsedObject}s the user can put a breakpoint on.
	 * @param message
	 *            is a user-readable message that describes the breakpoint
	 *            event.
	 * @param args
	 *            Any additional arguments to embed in the message
	 * @throws DebuggerKilledException
	 *             exception if someone called {@link #kill()} and the runMode
	 *             was set to {@link RunMode#KILLED}, or if the breakpoint halts
	 *             and is subsequently interrupted. This is because such an
	 *             interrupt is caused by an interrupted() call to the thread
	 *             which happens only when this agent has to die.

/**
 * <p>
 * Provides two functions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Provides control over the run mode of an agent.
 * <li>Provides listener functionality so that others can hear about debug
 * events happening here.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is exactly 1 debugger for each agent, but at several places we create
 * temporary Debuggers when we do some "dirty" coding by directly calling the
 * agent's databases. These temporary debuggers avoid the user seeing
 * breakpoints occur when he for example makes a manual query in the debugger,
 * or when the initialization is being done of the databases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the core, various breakpoints have been defined for agents. At each of
 * these breakpoints, an agent will call
 * {@link SteppingDebugger#breakpoint(String, Channel)}. Upon such calls, the
 * debugger checks whether any {@link DebugObserver} that subscribed to the
 * debugger wants to view messages associated with the breakpoint.
 * <p>
 *
 * If someone (not necessarily a {@link DebugObserver}) wants to pause on a
 * breakpoint, the debugger enforces this and makes the agent pause on the next
 * breakpoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The debugger is used to view debug events as follows:<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a {@link DebugObserver} and implement its interface.
 * <li> {@link #subscribe(DebugObserver)} the {@link DebugObserver} to interact
 * with the debugger of the agent.
 * <li>Call {@link #addPause(DebugObserver, Channel)} and
 * {@link #subscribe(DebugObserver, Channel)} as necessary.
 * <li>Run the agent.
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * See also the notes with {@link #breakpoint(String, Channel)}
 * <p>
 * We currently do not use a standard Observer/Observable pattern because agents
 * may not be interested in all events, depending on the debug settings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To control the debugger and the agent running, you can directly call
 * {@link #finestep()}, {@link #step()} and {@link #run()}. To kill the agent,
 * call {@link #kill()}.

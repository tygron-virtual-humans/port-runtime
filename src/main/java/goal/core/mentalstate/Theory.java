/**
 * Represents a set of formulas that have been inserted into a corresponding
 * database. A theory is associated with a corresponding database. A theory thus
 * is the equivalent at the GOAL level of a database created by some kr
 * technology. A theory is used to represent the belief base, percept base,
 * mailbox, and goal base (which consists of multiple databases each of which
 * have an associated theory).
 *
 * Formulas in a theory need to be {@link DatabaseFormula}, i.e. formulas that
 * can be inserted into a database created by the associated KR technology.
 *
 * Summarizing, the motivation for introducing the Theory class are that it
 * allows to: - represent the content of belief and goal bases, as well as
 * databases in general. - avoid the need for (complex) access methods to
 * databases maintained by the underlying knowledge technology such as Prolog. -
 * avoid duplication of clauses or facts in a database (a Theory itself is a
 * set).

	 * A knowledge base is only used for the agent itself (the owner of this

	 * The percepts the agent receives from its environment are stored in its
	 * percept base. This base is cleaned every reasoning cycle and the new
	 * percepts received are inserted.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * A percept base is only used for the agent itself (the owner of this
	 * mental model) and not for other agents because the agent does not have
	 * access to what another agent observes (and should store what it believes
	 * another agent has observed in that agent's mental model's belief base).

	 * The mail messages the agent receives from and sents to other agents are
	 * stored in its mailbox. This base is not cleaned but new messages are
	 * added. It is up to the agent itself to remove old messages.
	 * </p>

	 * For reasons similar to those given for percepts above, a mailbox is only
	 * used for the agent itself (the owner of this mental model) and not for
	 * other agents.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The beliefs of the agent that represent its environment are stored in its
	 * belief base. This is a base that is updated at runtime and used for
	 * maintaining an accurate picture of the actual state of affairs.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * A belief base is also used for other modeling the beliefs of other agents
	 * than the agent itself. That is, for maintaining a mental model of another
	 * agent's beliefs. The agent, of course, does not have direct access to

/**
 * <p>
 * A goal base consists of a set of individual or single goals. Each individual
 * goal is represented as a single goal that consists of an update It should
 * correspond with the database, except possibly for background knowledge
 * present in the database which is not reflected in the theory. In order to
 * ensure the theory corresponds correctly in this sense with the database, any
 * changes to the belief base need to be made by using the methods provided by
 * this class. By directly modifying the underlying database, the correspondence
 * may be lost. Background knowledge added to the database is assumed to be
 * static. Additionally, the predicates declared/defined in the goal base's
 * theory and in background theories should not overlap (this will raise
 * exceptions when inserting the background knowledge into a Prolog database).
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that each goal of the agent is implemented as a separate database.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The notification of changes works as follows. GoalBases representing modules
 * notify their parent module. This notification chain is created in
 * {@link MentalModel#focus}. Therefore, listeners for changes in goalbases can
 * observe the topmost goalbase and then also will be notified of submodule
 * changes.
 * </p>
